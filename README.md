# Marcus Bullock â€” Data Engineering & AI Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio.  
I design and build scalable, distributed data solutions using Python, Databricks, Spark, Delta Lake, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).  
This portfolio contains end-to-end projects that demonstrate my ability to handle data ingestion, transformation, storage, analysis, and deployment.
