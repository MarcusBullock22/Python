# Jarvis: Voice-Activated AI Assistant

Jarvis is a real-time voice assistant that listens to user speech, generates intelligent responses using OpenAI GPT models, 
and speaks the reply back to the user. It combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech to 
create an immersive conversational AI experience.
