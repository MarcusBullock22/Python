The purpose of this program was to solve a couple of issues:
1. Find a solution within Python that will allow for auto emailing in a confined system space
2. Remedy restricted access to outlook via signin

To run this program, you must have outlook up. You will also need an excel file or whatever file/link you 
may want to use. Verify an updated date column is also present for data verification after you've
done so. Once those fields are set, this pulls the column "Data sources" or whatever you may want
to name it. It will then list all fields tied to the appropriate email on the csv file. 

I've added a group by, so that the email will only be sent once, this is so that no one is being spammed.
This will also find every data source or other data that was tied to the exact email and include it
in one big email for the user.
